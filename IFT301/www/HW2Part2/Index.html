    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>
        Habitat for Humanity believes that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe and affordable place to live. 
        We build and repair houses all over the world using volunteer labor and donations. 
        Our partner families purchase these houses through no-profit, no-interest mortgage loans or innovative financing methods.

    <h1>Why We Build</h1>
    <p>
        There are nearly 2 billion people around the world who live in slum housing and more than 100 million are homeless. 
        Families left homeless by natural disasters, war and civil unrest often face dire housing situations as they struggle to rebuild 
        their lives. We provide shelter and housing assistance to help these families recover.
