    <h1>Arizona State University Polytechnic campus </h1>

    <h3>A nexus for studies featuring opportunities for project-based learning within advanced laboratory spaces.</h3>

    <p>The ASU Polytechnic campus is a nexus for studies in interdisciplinary sciences, engineering, management, technology and education. 
        Industry partnerships are key to the campusâ€™ distinctive course offerings, which provide opportunities for project-based learning within advanced 
        laboratory spaces. Specialized equipment for hands-on exploration includes simulators for flight and centers for consumer behavior research, semiconductor fabrication, comprehensive commercial printing and design services, and on-demand digital manufacturing.
        The expansive Polytechnic campus incorporates a major regional airport yet maintains the ambiance of a small, self-contained community by offering family housing, a freshman residence hall, dining facilities and a student recreation center.
        A desert arboretum reserves a peaceful native space devoted to sustainability, preservation and contemplation. 
        Within a 30-minute drive of the campus are hiking and recreational opportunities amid the legendary Superstition Mountains, with small and large lakes nearby.
